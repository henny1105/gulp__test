                    RESU is a home battery brand of LG Energy Solution which stands for Residential Energy Storage
                    Unit.
                </dd>
                <dt>What are the benefits of a home battery?
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>(1) Home battery allows you to store energy generated from your solar system. Therefore, If
                    you’re not at home when you solar system is generating power, or if your solar system are
                    generating more energy than what you’re consuming at the moment, you can store the generated
                    energy / left-over onto the home battery and use the energy whenever you need it.<br>
                    (2) A home battery can supports you during a black-out. You can pull the stored energy out from
                    the battery when the power is cut off. A home battery is a great solution which bright you a
                    peace-of-mind.<br>
                    (3) If your utility charges you different electricity rates at different times, you can use the
                    battery-stored energy during the times at which higher rate is applied to avoid an increase in
                    your electricity bill.</dd>

                <dt>If I don’t have a solar system yet but would like to install one soon, can I install the solar system with a RESU home battery? 
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>RESU home battery provides you with a flexibility to install for both cases – new or existing
                    solar system.</dd>

                <dt>Can you briefly explain me the steps I would be going through to purchase a RESU home battery?
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>First, you would contact an installer who are certified to install a RESU home battery. The
                    installer would ask for your home’s historical energy production & consumption data to recommend
                    you a right product option from the RESU home battery line-ups. Installer might visit your home
                    before designing the personalized RESU system for you. Once the RESU installation date is fixed,
                    it would take less than a day to install.</dd>

                <dt>Where can I install a RESU home battery?
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>RESU can be installed at both sites – inside and outside of your house – as a stand type or a
                    wall mounting type. Please consult with a certified installer to discuss the best spot which
                    best suits your needs and also your country’s regulation.</dd>

                <dt>Can I use a RESU home battery as a back-up power during black-out?
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>Please contact your installer to report the problem. Since the installer who has installed your
                    RESU home battery is a LG Energy Solution’s certified installer, he will receive all the support
                    he needs from LG Energy Solution to fix the problem.</dd>

                <dt>Why should I choose LG Energy Solution over other home battery manufacturers present in the market?
                    <i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
                </dt>
                <dd>Unlike other home appliances, home battery is a product you would be using for about a decade.
                    Therefore, you need a company who can support you throughout the long period of your battery
                    lifetime. As a result, sustainability of a battery manufacturer is the key. LG Energy Solution
                    has been in the battery business since 1999, and started to produce home battery since 2012.
